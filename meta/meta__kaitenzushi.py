There are NN dishes in a row on a kaiten belt, with the iith dish being of
type DiDiâ€‹. Some dishes may be of the same type as one another.

You're very hungry, but you'd also like to keep things interesting. The NN
dishes will arrive in front of you, one after another in order, and for each
one you'll eat it as long as it isn't the same type as any of the previous KK
dishes you've eaten. You eat very fast, so you can consume a dish before the
next one gets to you. Any dishes you choose not to eat as they pass will be
eaten by others.

Determine how many dishes you'll end up eating.

Please take care to write a solution which runs within the time limit.

Discussion:

The solution below fails due to time limit exceeded on one test case, passing
32/33 test cases.

Approach is to use both a set and a deque to keep track of the
last K dishes eaten. The set is for fast lookup of whether we've eaten
a candidate dish. The deque is for maintaining an ordered list
of the dishes eaten, so once we get to K dishes eaten and we're going to
eat a new one, we can know which dish to remove from the set of eaten
dishes.

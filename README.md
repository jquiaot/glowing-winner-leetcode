# glowing-winner-leetcode - Leetcode and Other Problems and Solutions

This repository contains practice coding problems and coding problems used
in technical screening interviews, as well as solutions I've coded myself.

To the extent that I'm able to verify correctness via the source of the 
problem (i.e., passes Leetcode submission), I've done so.

Depending on bandwidth and my abilities, I've attempted to supply a
discussion of the solution approach, and time and space complexity.
However, I can't guarantee correctness (i.e., time/space bounds might not
be tight enough, or descriptive enough, or simply wrong). (With extreme
apologies to my 6.018 professors and recitation instructors, I know you
tried to teach me all of this, and I can't thank you enough for your
instruction.)

If you find an error, and are feeling charitable, please let me know so
I can go ahead and fix it.

If you've found this useful, I request you pay it forward and help others
who are learning computer science or programming. Also, if you end up
sharing this with others, I ask that you provide a link to this repo.
